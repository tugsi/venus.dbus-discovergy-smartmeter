# dbus-discovergy-smartmeter Service

## Under work.... I wanna rename all to discoovergy and make it a little bit more comfortable

### Purpose

This service is meant to be run on a raspberry Pi with Venus OS from Victron.

The Python script cyclically reads data from the Discovergy SmartMeter via the Discovaergy Online API and publishes information on the dbus, using the service name com.victronenergy.grid. This makes the Venus OS work as if you had a physical Victron Grid Meter installed.

### Configuration

In the Python file, you should put the MeterID of your Discovergy device and the Username / Password of your account.
If you didnÂ´t know your MeterID, just go to [Discovergy API Meters](https://api.discovergy.com/public/v1/meters) and insert your username password to get all you need. 

### Installation

1. Copy the files to the /data folder on your venus:

   - /data/dbus-fronius-smartmeter/dbus-fronius-smartmeter.py
   - /data/dbus-fronius-smartmeter/kill_me.sh
   - /data/dbus-fronius-smartmeter/service/run

2. Set permissions for files:

   `chmod 755 /data/dbus-fronius-smartmeter/service/run`

   `chmod 744 /data/dbus-fronius-smartmeter/kill_me.sh`

3. Get two files from the [velib_python](https://github.com/victronenergy/velib_python) and install them on your venus:

   - /data/dbus-fronius-smartmeter/vedbus.py
   - /data/dbus-fronius-smartmeter/ve_utils.py

4. Add a symlink to the file /data/rc.local:

   `ln -s /data/dbus-fronius-smartmeter/service /service/dbus-fronius-smartmeter`

   Or if that file does not exist yet, store the file rc.local from this service on your Raspberry Pi as /data/rc.local .
   You can then create the symlink by just running rc.local:
  
   `rc.local`

   The daemon-tools should automatically start this service within seconds.

### Debugging

You can check the status of the service with svstat:

`svstat /service/dbus-fronius-smartmeter`

It will show something like this:

`/service/dbus-fronius-smartmeter: up (pid 10078) 325 seconds`

If the number of seconds is always 0 or 1 or any other small number, it means that the service crashes and gets restarted all the time.

When you think that the script crashes, start it directly from the command line:

`python /data/dbus-fronius-smartmeter/dbus-fronius-smartmeter.py`

and see if it throws any error messages.

If the script stops with the message

`dbus.exceptions.NameExistsException: Bus name already exists: com.victronenergy.grid"`

it means that the service is still running or another service is using that bus name.

#### Restart the script

If you want to restart the script, for example after changing it, just run the following command:

`/data/dbus-fronius-smartmeter/kill_me.sh`

The daemon-tools will restart the scriptwithin a few seconds.

### Hardware

In my installation at home, I am using the following Hardware:

- HMT2250 - PV Grid Tied Inverter (three phases)
- Discovergy Gridmeter - (three phases)
- Victron MultiPlus-II - Battery Inverter (single phase)
- Raspberry Pi 3B+ - For running Venus OS
- SEPLOS MASON 280 - LiFePO Battery
